# Proplistings by FLGX

I add more functionalities for Angular2 and Firebase course by Traversi Media Courses on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-RfqbYftYr5T6bv9idBU7oyADoZ).


## New features added
* Live search.
* Multiple images upload.
* I add `ng2-bootstrap` module to get bootstrap carousel for the images.
* Individual image delete from storage and database.

#Notes
On firebase i create a new node called `images` to save the image path, listing id and image name.
I want to heart about new features and fixes.

Enjoy it.
